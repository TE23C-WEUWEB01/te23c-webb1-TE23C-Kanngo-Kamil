    <h1><em>Blonde</em> (Frank Ocean album)</h1>
    <img src="./Blonde_-_Frank_Ocean.jpeg" alt="Blonde">
    <p><strong><em>Blonde</em></strong> is the second studio album by the American singer Frank Ocean. It was released on August 20, 2016, as a timed exclusive on the iTunes Store and Apple Music, and followed the August 19 release of Ocean's video album <em>Endless</em>. The album features guest vocals from André 3000, Beyoncé, and Kim Burrell, among others. Production was handled by Ocean himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers, including Malay and Om'Mas Keith, who collaborated with Ocean on <em>Channel Orange</em>, as well as James Blake, Jon Brion, Buddy Ross, Pharrell Williams, and Rostam Batmanglij, among others.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Ocean confirmed that his follow up to <em>Channel Orange</em> would be another concept album. Initially known as <em>Boys Don't Cry</em> and teased for a July 2015 release, the album suffered several delays and was the subject of widespread media anticipation leading up to its release. Recording for the album took place throughout 2013 and 2016 at New York's Electric Lady Studios and, after a period of writer's block, in London at Abbey Road Studios and in Los Angeles' Henson Recording Studios. Its physical release was accompanied by a magazine entitled <em>Boys Don't Cry</em>.</p>
    <p><em>Blonde</em> features an abstract and experimental sound in comparison to Ocean's previous releases, encompassing styles such as R&B, pop, soul, avant-garde, indie rock, electronica, psychedelia, and hip hop. Ocean also notably makes use of pitch shifted vocals. The Beach Boys' <em>de facto</em> leader Brian Wilson is recognized as a strong influence on the album's lush arrangements and layered vocal harmonies, while the guitar and keyboard rhythms on the album are considered as languid and minimal. The album's themes surround Ocean dealing with his masculinity and emotions, inspired by sexual experiences, heartbreak, loss, duality, and trauma.</p>
    <p><em>Blonde</em> received widespread acclaim, with critics praising Ocean's introspective lyrics and the album's unconventional and progressive sounds. Critics also complimented the album for challenging the conventions of R&B and pop music. Supported by its lead single "Nikes", the album debuted at number one in several countries, including the United States. It earned first week sales of 275,000 with album-equivalent units in the US, with 232,000 being pure sales, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Among other publications, <em>Time</em> named it the best album of 2016. Metacritic named it one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the year by music publications. In 2020, <em>Pitchfork</em> named it the best album of the 2010s and <em>Rolling Stone</em> ranked it at number 79 on their updated list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p>
