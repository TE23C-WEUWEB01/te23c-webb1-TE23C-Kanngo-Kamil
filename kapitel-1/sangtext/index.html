    <h1>Nights</h1>
    <h2>Song lyrics</h2>
    <p>'Round your city, 'round the clock<br>
        Everybody needs you<br>
        No, you can't make everybody equal<br>
        Although you got beaucoup family<br>
        You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you<br>
        Breathe 'til I evaporated<br>
        My whole body see through<br>
        Transportation, handmade (G)<br>
        And I know it better than most people<br>
        I don't trust 'em anyways<br>
        You can't break the law with them<br>
        Get some gushy, have a calm night<br>
        Shooters killin' left and right<br>
        Workin' through your worst night<br>
        If I get my money right<br>
        You know I won't need you<br>
        And I tell you (Bitch)<br>
        I hope the sack is full up<br>
        I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up<br>
        Spend it when I get that<br>
        I ain't tryna keep you<br>
        Can't keep up a conversation<br>
        Can't nobody reach you<br>
        Why your eyes well up?<br>
        Did you call me from a s√©ance?<br>
        You are from my past life<br>
        Hope you're doin' well, bruh<br>
        I been out here head first<br>
        Always like the head first<br>
        Signal comin' in and out<br>
        Hope you're doin' well, bruh<br>
        Everybody needs you<br>
        Everybody needs you<br>
        Ooh, 'nani-'nani<br>
        This feel like a Quaalude<br>
        No sleep in my body<br>
        Ain't no bitch in my body, ah</p>
    <p>New beginnings, ahh<br>
        New beginnings, wake up, akh<br>
        The sun's goin' down<br>
        Time to start your day, bruh<br>
        Can't keep bein' laid off<br>
        Know you need the money if you gon' survive<br>
        Every night shit, every day shit</p>
    <p>Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift<br>
        You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit<br>
        That kumbaya shit<br>
        Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet<br>
        Wanna feel that 'na-'na though, could you come by?<br>
        Fuck with me after my shift<br>
        Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit<br>
        Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit<br>
        That's every day shit<br>
        Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation<br>
        Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation<br>
        My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit<br>
        (Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)</p>
    <p>All my night, been ready for you all my night<br>
        Been waitin' on you all my night<br>
        I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside<br>
        All my night, you been missin' all my night<br>
        Still got some good nights memorized<br>
        And the look back's gettin' me right</p>
    <p>Every night fucks every day up<br>
        Every day patches the night up<br>
        On God, you should match it, it's that KO<br>
        No white lighters 'til I fuck my twenty-eighth up (Fire)<br>
        1998, my family had that Acura (Fire)<br>
        Oh, the Legend (Fire)<br>
        Kept at least six discs in the changer<br>
        Back when Boswell and Percy had it active (Massive)<br>
        Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions (Massive)<br>
        All the reverends<br>
        Preachin' self-made millionaire status<br>
        When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion<br>
        After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus<br>
        Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited<br>
        Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address<br>
        Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress<br>
        Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night</p>
    <p>Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah<br>
        You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit<br>
        That kumbaya shit<br>
        Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet<br>
        Wanna feel that 'na-'na though, could you come by?<br>
        Fuck with me after my shift<br>
        Know them boys wanna see me broke down<br>
        See me bummed out, stressed out<br>
        That's just every day shit<br>
        Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation<br>
        Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation<br>
        Every day shit, every day shit<br>
        Every night shit, every day shit<br>
        Every day shit, every day shit<br>
        Every day shit, every night shit</p>

        <p><strong>"Nights"</strong> (sometimes styled as <strong>"Night.s"</strong>) is a song by the American R&B singer Frank Ocean, released as a part of his second studio album <em>Blonde</em> (2016). The track debuted at number 98 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 chart, despite not being released as a single. In August 2024, a version of the song featuring Kendrick Lamar leaked online.</p>
        <p>"Nights" is a two-part track. The first part is an upbeat guitar driven section in which Ocean raps about a tedious nine to five job and the highs and lows of a previous relationship. In the ending of the first verse, Ocean moves away from the past, and discusses his anger with letting a relationship go. At 3:30 in the song, the halfway point in the album, the beat switches. The second half of the song features a slower, synth-heavy beat. Ocean raps about the struggles he dealt with in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which forced him to temporarily relocate from New Orleans to Houston.</p>
